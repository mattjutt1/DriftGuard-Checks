  # Some simpler examples that should still pass at 70% threshold
- Write a function to calculate the area of a circle. Include input validation and return appropriate error messages for invalid inputs.

- Create a simple contact form with HTML and JavaScript that validates email addresses and shows success/error messages to users.

- Explain how to use Git branches for feature development. Include commands for creating, switching, merging, and deleting branches.

# Configuration Notes for Permissive Mode:
# - 70% threshold allows good but not perfect prompts to pass
# - Includes simpler examples suitable for learning environments
# - More forgiving for junior developers or teams new to prompt engineering
# - Balances learning with maintaining some quality standards
# - Good for iterative improvement and building prompt writing skills
