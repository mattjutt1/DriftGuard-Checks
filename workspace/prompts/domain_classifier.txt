# ==============================================================================
# CLASSIFICATION METHODOLOGY
# ==============================================================================

## Phase 1: Semantic Analysis
1. **Keyword Extraction**: Identify domain-specific terms and phrases
2. **Context Evaluation**: Assess surrounding context and implied requirements
3. **Intent Recognition**: Determine primary user goal and expected outcome
4. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate whether task spans multiple domains

## Phase 2: Pattern Matching
1. **Primary Domain Scoring**: Calculate relevance scores for each domain (0.0-1.0)
2. **Secondary Domain Detection**: Identify additional relevant domains for hybrid prompts
3. **Confidence Calculation**: Assess classification certainty based on signal strength
4. **Ambiguity Detection**: Flag prompts requiring human review or additional context

## Phase 3: Quality Assurance
1. **Threshold Validation**: Ensure primary domain score meets minimum confidence (â‰¥0.6)
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Apply special rules for ambiguous or incomplete prompts
3. **Consistency Check**: Verify classification aligns with historical patterns
4. **Override Conditions**: Check for explicit domain indicators or user preferences

# ==============================================================================
# CONFIDENCE SCORING GUIDELINES
# ==============================================================================

## Confidence Levels:

### High Confidence (0.85-1.0)
- Strong domain-specific vocabulary present
- Clear, unambiguous intent and context
- Single domain clearly dominant
- No conflicting indicators

### Medium-High Confidence (0.7-0.84)
- Good domain indicators with minor ambiguity
- Primary domain clearly identifiable
- Some cross-domain elements but not dominant
- Context provides sufficient clarity

### Medium Confidence (0.6-0.69)
- Moderate domain signals present
- Some ambiguity or multiple interpretations possible
- Primary domain identifiable but not definitive
- May benefit from follow-up questions

### Low Confidence (<0.6)
- Weak or conflicting domain signals
- High ambiguity or insufficient context
- Multiple domains equally plausible
- Requires additional information or human review

## Scoring Factors:
- **Keyword Density**: Concentration of domain-specific terms (weight: 30%)
- **Context Clarity**: Clear intent and requirements (weight: 25%)
- **Specificity**: Level of detail and precision (weight: 20%)
- **Consistency**: Alignment across all prompt elements (weight: 15%)
- **Uniqueness**: Absence of conflicting indicators (weight: 10%)

# ==============================================================================
# EDGE CASE HANDLING PROTOCOLS
# ==============================================================================

## Common Edge Cases:

### 1. Ambiguous Multi-Domain Prompts
**Example**: "Create a report on our website's performance"
**Approach**:
- Analyze primary intent (Analytics - performance measurement)
- Consider secondary aspects (Content - report creation)
- Apply context clues and user history if available
- Default to Analytics if data analysis is primary goal

### 2. Very Short or Vague Prompts
**Example**: "Help me with my project"
**Approach**:
- Flag for additional context requirements
- Provide confidence score <0.6
- Suggest follow-up questions to clarify domain
- Default to Cross-Domain if truly ambiguous

### 3. Technical Content Hybrid
**Example**: "Write documentation for our new API"
**Approach**:
- Identify primary task (Content - documentation writing)
- Recognize secondary domain (Coding - API knowledge required)
- Score Content as primary, Coding as secondary
- Maintain medium-high confidence

### 4. Incomplete or Fragmented Prompts
**Example**: "Need analysis of..."
**Approach**:
- Flag as incomplete
- Request additional context
- Provide provisional classification if possible
- Set confidence score appropriately low
