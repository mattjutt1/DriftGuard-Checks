3. Ensure consistency with domain-specific considerations
4. Document specific evidence for each dimensional score

#### Step 2: Composite Score Calculation
1. Apply domain-specific weighting adjustments to base weights
2. Calculate weighted sum: Σ(Dimension Score × Adjusted Weight)
3. Determine excellence multiplier eligibility and apply if appropriate
4. Add domain bonus points if criteria are met
5. Verify final score falls within 0.0-1.0 range

#### Step 3: Holistic Validation
1. Compare calculated score against overall quality thresholds
2. Verify score accurately represents prompt transformation quality
3. Ensure score aligns with expected professional usability
4. Cross-check against similar prompts and quality examples
