# HuggingFace Space Update Instructions

## Requirements.txt Fix

The build is failing because HuggingFace's build system isn't installing the transformers module. 

### Update your requirements.txt file to contain ONLY these lines:

```
transformers==4.45.2
accelerate==0.34.2
sentencepiece==0.2.0
safetensors==0.4.5
einops==0.8.0
```

### Why this works:
- HuggingFace automatically installs `gradio` and `spaces` 
- We only need to specify the ML libraries that aren't auto-installed
- This prevents version conflicts and ensures transformers gets installed

## How to Apply:

1. Go to your HuggingFace Space: https://huggingface.co/spaces/unfiltrdfreedom/prompt-evolver
2. Click on "Files" tab
3. Click on `requirements.txt`
4. Click "Edit" button
5. Replace the entire content with the 5 lines above
6. Click "Commit changes to main"
7. The Space will automatically rebuild

## What to Expect:

After the build completes (usually 2-3 minutes), your Space should show:
- Model loading status
- GPU availability status  
- A working Gradio interface for prompt optimization

## Monitoring the Build:

Watch the "Logs" tab in your Space to see:
1. Dependencies being installed (you should see transformers being installed)
2. App starting up
3. Model loading messages
4. Gradio interface launching

## If Still Having Issues:

The app.py file has fallback modes:
- If transformers can't import: Mock mode activates
- If model can't load: Returns test responses
- If GPU not available: Uses CPU (slower but works)

This ensures the Space always provides some functionality even if the full model doesn't load.
