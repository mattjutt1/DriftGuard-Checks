# QUALITY.md - Quality Standards and Testing

## Enhanced Quality Standards

- **Code Coverage**: Minimum 85% test coverage with focus on critical paths
- **Performance**: API responses <200ms, AI processing <5 seconds, React 19 optimizations
- **Security**: All inputs validated, JWT authentication, intelligent rate limiting
- **User Experience**: Dual-mode optimization, real-time progress, error recovery
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + TypeScript compliance, working quality over rigid formatting
- **Integration Quality**: Advanced error handling, retry logic, health checking
- **Technology Standards**: Next.js 15 + React 19 patterns, Turbopack optimization

## Enhanced Performance Targets

- **API Response Time**: <200ms (excluding AI processing)
- **AI Processing Time**: <5 seconds for prompt optimization
- **Memory Usage**: <4GB VRAM for Qwen3:4b model, <2GB RAM for application
- **Build Performance**: <5s development builds with Turbopack
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 100+ simultaneous optimizations
- **Database Queries**: <10ms for simple, <100ms for complex
- **React 19 Benefits**: Improved concurrent rendering, better hydration
- **Real-time Updates**: <100ms WebSocket response times

### **Integration Quality Standards**

#### **Framework Compliance vs. Practical Benefits**

**Prioritize:**
1. **Working Quality**: Code that works reliably over code that passes arbitrary style checks
2. **User Experience**: Features that improve actual user outcomes
3. **Developer Productivity**: Tools and patterns that enable faster, better development
4. **Maintainability**: Code organization that facilitates future changes
5. **Performance**: Measurable improvements in speed, reliability, or resource usage

**De-prioritize:**
1. **Rigid Tool Compliance**: Perfect Prettier formatting over working features
2. **Architectural Purity**: Complex patterns that don't solve real problems
3. **Premature Optimization**: Performance work without measured bottlenecks
4. **Over-Abstraction**: Generic solutions for specific, simple problems

#### **AVSHA Quality Gates**
1. **Atomic Validation**: Each atom has single responsibility and clear interface
2. **Molecular Composition**: Molecules properly compose atoms without tight coupling
3. **Organism Boundaries**: Complex components maintain clear dependencies
4. **Feature Cohesion**: Feature slices maintain high internal cohesion
5. **Cross-Feature Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between feature slices
6. **Template Consistency**: Layout patterns are consistent across features
7. **Page Integration**: Top-level pages properly integrate all layers

#### **Knowledge Graph Integration**
