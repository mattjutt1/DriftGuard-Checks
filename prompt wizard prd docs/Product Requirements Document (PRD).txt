# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## PromptEvolver 3.0 - AI-Powered Prompt Enhancement SaaS Platform
**Version:** 2.0
**Owner:** PromptEvolver Team
**Last updated:** 2025-08-08

---

## 1) Problem, Vision, Non-Goals

### Problem
- Users submit vague prompts to LLMs and receive inconsistent results. Manual prompt engineering is slow, unscalable, and hard to standardize across domains.
- **Critical insight**: PromptWizard shows black-box prompt optimization is powerful but is **not suitable for live production use** due to multi-call latency and cost (5-150 API calls per prompt, ~$0.05-$2.00 per optimization).
- **Core issue**: PromptWizard is a *design-time tool for discovering static prompts*, not a real-time engine for transforming user inputs. Its iterative, multi-call nature creates unacceptable latency for commercial applications.

### Vision
- Ship a production-grade prompt enhancement platform that transforms vague user inputs into clear, constraint-rich, evaluable prompts with strict schema compliance and minimal token overhead.
- Deliver measurable downstream uplift on representative tasks (e.g., +5-15% GSM8K exact-match, HumanEval pass@k uplift) while maintaining commercial licensing compliance.
- Create a scalable SaaS platform with tiered pricing for both individual users and enterprise teams.

### Non-Goals
- Running PromptWizard online in production requests (use only for offline meta-prompt discovery).
- Guaranteeing deterministic outputs; we implement best-effort reproducibility only.
- Building a universal prompt optimizer for all possible LLMs (focus on Qwen3-30B A3B as primary target).

---

## 2) Users and Use Cases

### Primary users
- **Individual users**: Developers, analysts, content creators who want better results from LLMs
- **Teams**: Organizations wanting to standardize prompt quality across employees
- **Enterprise**: Companies seeking to integrate prompt enhancement into their workflow

### Key use cases with concrete examples

#### Analytics
- **Input:** "Analyze the data"
- **Output:** engineered prompt with `<OBJECTIVE>` analysis goals, `<CONTEXT>` dataset and fields, `<REQUIREMENTS>` statistics and visuals, `<OUTPUT_FORMAT>` JSON schema, `<EVALUATION_CRITERIA>` accuracy/coherence checks.

#### Coding
- **Input:** "Make this faster"
- **Output:** problem profile, constraints (time/memory), benchmarks, acceptance tests, expected diff format.

#### Content
- **Input:** "Write about cybersecurity"
- **Output:** audience, scope, citations policy, tone, length limits, JSON outline, evaluation rubric.

#### Cross-Domain
- **Input:** "Help me plan a product launch"
- **Output:** workflow decomposition, stakeholder mapping, timeline constraints, success metrics.

---

## 3) Scope and Success Criteria

### In scope
- Data pipeline to normalize or synthesize "simple → engineered" pairs with domain weighting.
- Multi-stage fine-tuning (foundational instruction tuning → prompt transformation specialization → optional reasoning enhancement).
- Domain-specific training and evaluation with failure mode analysis.
- Evaluation suite: schema conformance, LLM-as-judge rubric, downstream A/B uplift, token overhead tracking.
- Inference server exposing `/enhance` with "lite/full" verbosity modes and fallback mechanisms.
- CI checks for schema, dataset license verification, and domain-specific failure monitoring.
- User feedback integration system for continuous improvement.

### Success criteria (measurable targets)

#### Schema & Quality
- Schema conformance: ≥ 98% validation outputs contain all required tags.
- Rubric: mean ≥ 8.0/10 on clarity, specificity, output format, evaluation criteria, safety, cost awareness.
- Domain-specific quality: ≥ 8.5/10 for analytics, ≥ 8.0/10 for coding, ≥ 9.0/10 for content, ≥ 7.5/10 for cross-domain.

#### Performance & Efficiency
- Downstream uplift: statistically significant improvement vs raw prompts on at least 2 tasks (e.g., +5–15% exact-match on a GSM8K slice; pass@k uplift on HumanEval subset).
- Token efficiency: median engineered prompt length within policy thresholds in "lite" mode while maintaining uplift.
- Fallback usage: < 5% of requests should require fallback mechanisms.
- User satisfaction: ≥ 80% positive feedback on enhanced prompts in A/B testing.

#### Reliability & Operations
- Reproducibility discipline: all evals stamped with seeds, configs, and model/version fingerprints.
- Schema version compatibility: ≥ 95% of v1.0 prompts successfully upgraded to v1.2 schema.
- Feedback loop impact: 30% reduction in recurring failure modes within 30 days of feedback collection.

---

## 4) Constraints and Assumptions

- **Commercial licensing only** for training datasets; maintain provenance and hashes in `DATA_MANIFEST.md`.
- **Best-effort reproducibility**; API or backend changes can cause drift (mitigated by versioning and fallbacks).
- **Cost sensitivity**: limit token inflation; provide "lite" mode with strict token budgeting per domain.
- **Domain awareness**: system must identify and handle analytics, coding, content, and cross-domain prompts appropriately.
- **Schema evolution**: prompt schema will evolve; must support backward compatibility through versioning.

---

## 5) Data and Licensing

### Sources (commercial-friendly first; verify each license in `DATA_MANIFEST.md`)

#### Instruction-following (Stage 1 Training)
- **Databricks Dolly 15k** (CC BY-SA 3.0 share-alike) - human-written, commercial OK
- **OpenAssistant OASST1** (Apache-2.0) - multi-turn chat data
- **Evol-Instruct via H2O.ai** (Apache-2.0) - synthetically generated high-complexity instructions

#### Prompt-transformation pairs (Stage 2 Training)
- **gokaygokay/prompt-enhancer-dataset** (Apache-2.0) - 18k high-quality examples
- **Bad-Improved Prompt Pairs** (Apache-2.0) - 1.2k verified examples
- **Synthetic pairs** generated in-house using PromptWizard offline
- **Domain-specific pairs** (custom generation with 30% analytics, 30% coding, 25% content, 15% cross-domain)

#### Reasoning Enhancement (Stage 3 Training - Optional)
- **GSM8K** (MIT) - 8.5k math problems with step-by-step solutions
- **HumanEval** (MIT) - 164 code generation problems with unit tests

### Avoid or regenerate
- **Alpaca** (CC BY-NC 4.0 non-commercial) - replace with Evol-Instruct generated data
- **Unclear ShareGPT variants** - use only commercially cleared versions
- **WizardLM Evol-Instruct V2** - use MIT subset only, avoid ShareGPT-derived examples

### Data Generation Strategy

#### Phase 1: Seed Collection (Weeks 1-2)
- Curate 500+ high-quality examples from Apache-2.0 licensed `gokaygokay/prompt-enhancer-dataset`
- Generate 300+ domain-specific examples using PromptWizard *offline* with domain-specific configurations
- Extract 200+ examples from GSM8K where answers contain structured reasoning

#### Phase 2: Domain Weighting & Expansion (Weeks 3-4)
- **Domain Distribution Targets**:
  | Domain | Target % | Special Handling |
  |--------|----------|------------------|
  | Analytics | 30% | Include schema validation rules, statistical requirements |
  | Coding | 30% | Include test harness requirements, performance constraints |
  | Content | 25% | Include citation policies, audience targeting |
  | Cross-domain | 15% | Include constraint propagation, workflow decomposition |

- **Negative Example Generation**:
  - Create subtle failure cases (missing tags, over-constrained requirements, ambiguous formats)
  - Target 20% negative examples in training data for robustness

#### Phase 3: Quality Control Pipeline
- **Automated Validation**:
  ```yaml
  validation_rules:
    required_tags:
      - "<OBJECTIVE>"
      - "<CONTEXT>"
      - "<OUTPUT_FORMAT>"
      - "<EVALUATION_CRITERIA>"
    max_token_inflation: 2.5  # Enhanced prompt shouldn't exceed 2.5x original
    schema_compliance:
      - "JSON schema validation for <OUTPUT_FORMAT>"
      - "Required fields check for domain-specific templates"
  ```
- **Human-in-the-loop verification**: Flag ambiguous cases for human validation

  - Write unit tests for schema validation and upgrade functionality
- Task 2: Implement domain routing system
  - Create `src/domain/router.py` with DomainRouter class
  - Create domain-specific templates for each domain
  - Write tests for domain classification accuracy

**Phase 2: Core Engine Implementation (1 day)**
- Task 3: Build prompt enhancement engine
  - Create `src/engine/enhancer.py` with PromptEnhancer class
  - Implement multi-stage enhancement logic
  - Add schema validation to enhancement process
- Task 4: Create fallback mechanisms

### For Qwen Code Implementation:
Qwen Code is a viable alternative, especially since you're using Qwen3-30B as your base model. Follow this adapted approach:

**Micro-Task Implementation Strategy:**
1. Focus on one component at a time (schema versioning first)
2. Request smaller code snippets with clear integration points
3. Ask for Chinese/English bilingual comments if needed
4. Verify each component before moving to the next

**Implementation Sequence for Qwen Code:**
1. First: Schema versioning system (most foundational)
2. Second: Domain routing system
3. Third: Rule-based enhancement (fallback mechanism)
4. Fourth: API endpoints
5. Fifth: Usage tracking

**Verification Approach for Qwen Code:**
- After each component implementation:
  - Run unit tests
  - Verify integration with previous components
  - Check against PRD requirements
  - Document any deviations

This PRD provides a complete, production-ready framework for building a commercial prompt enhancement SaaS platform. The implementation guidance specifically tailored for AI assistants will ensure successful execution while maintaining alignment with the PRD requirements.
