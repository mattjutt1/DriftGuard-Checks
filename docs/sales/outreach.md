## 1. Initial Outreach (LinkedIn/Email)

**Subject:** Cut PR review time by 40% with automated prompt quality gates

Hi [Name],

Noticed [Company] is investing heavily in AI. One challenge we're solving: ensuring prompt quality at scale without slowing down development.

Prompt Gate adds GitHub-native quality checks that:
• Block bad prompts before they hit production
• Run offline (zero API costs by default)
• Install in literally 60 seconds

Worth a quick 15-min demo? We're offering pilot pricing at $500-1500/mo.

Best,
[Your name]
