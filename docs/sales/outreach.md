# Outreach Templates - Prompt Gate for GitHub

Ready-to-use email and DM templates for introducing Prompt Gate to potential customers.

## Template 1: Cold Outreach (Introduction)

**Subject:** Stop AI code quality issues before they reach production

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I noticed {{COMPANY}} is using AI tools for development (saw your recent {{SPECIFIC_REFERENCE}} - impressive work!).

Quick question: How are you ensuring AI-generated code maintains quality standards across your team?

Most engineering teams we work with are struggling with the same challenge - AI outputs are inconsistent, and traditional code review misses prompt-level quality issues. This leads to:

- 15-30% of dev time wasted on debugging poor AI outputs
- Inconsistent results across team members using the same tools
- No visibility into which prompts actually work well

We built **Prompt Gate for GitHub** to solve exactly this. It's a required status check that blocks low-quality prompts before they reach production - think of it as "CI/CD for prompt quality."

The best part? **5-minute setup, runs offline by default** (no API costs or data privacy concerns).

Would you be open to a 15-minute demo this week? I can show you how {{SIMILAR_COMPANY}} reduced their AI-related debugging time by 40% in the first month.

Best regards,
{{YOUR_NAME}}

P.S. Here's a 2-minute demo video if you want to see it in action first: {{DEMO_LINK}}

## Template 2: Follow-up (Value Reinforcement)

**Subject:** Re: Stop AI code quality issues before they reach production

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

Following up on my previous email about prompt quality gates at {{COMPANY}}.

Since we last spoke, I thought you might find this interesting - we just helped {{RECENT_CUSTOMER}} implement Prompt Gate, and they're seeing some impressive results after just 2 weeks:

✅ **3.2 hours saved per developer weekly** (less debugging, faster PR reviews)
✅ **62% reduction in production issues** from AI-generated code
✅ **Zero additional infrastructure costs** (runs offline by default)
✅ **Complete GitHub integration** (works with existing workflows)

Their engineering manager said: *"It's like having an automated code reviewer that actually understands prompt quality. Should have done this months ago."*

I know you mentioned concerns about {{SPECIFIC_OBJECTION}} - this is exactly what {{SIMILAR_COMPANY}} said before they tried our 14-day pilot program. No commitments, just results.

Are you available for a 15-minute call this {{DAY}} or {{DAY}}? I can show you the exact setup {{RECENT_CUSTOMER}} used and walk through their results dashboard.

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}

## Template 3: Closing (Pilot Offer)

**Subject:** 14-day Prompt Gate pilot - no risk, immediate results

{{FIRST_NAME}},

Thanks for the great conversation yesterday about {{COMPANY}}'s AI development workflow challenges.

As promised, here's the **14-day pilot proposal** for Prompt Gate:

**What you get:**

- ✅ Complete setup assistance (30-minute onboarding call)
- ✅ Custom prompt evaluation criteria for your domain
- ✅ Integration with your existing GitHub workflows
- ✅ Slack notifications and team dashboard
- ✅ Weekly check-ins with our implementation specialist

**What it costs:**

- $0 during the 14-day pilot
- No setup fees, no API costs (runs offline)
- Cancel anytime, keep the configuration

**Timeline:**

- **Week 1:** Setup and initial testing with your team
- **Week 2:** Full deployment with quality gates enabled
- **Day 15:** Results review and decision

Based on our conversation, I estimate you'll see **{{ESTIMATED_HOURS}} hours saved per developer weekly** and **{{ESTIMATED_ISSUES}}% fewer AI-related production issues**.

Ready to get started? I can have your team up and running by {{DATE}} - just reply with your preferred onboarding time.

Looking forward to helping {{COMPANY}} ship higher-quality AI code!

Best regards,
{{YOUR_NAME}}

**P.S.** {{MUTUAL_CONNECTION}} at {{REFERENCE_COMPANY}} said the pilot was "the easiest engineering decision we made this year." Happy to connect you two if helpful.
