  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server instead of the old Probot command.\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: force clean build and ensure

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit:

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By:

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit:

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By:

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit:

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit:

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By:

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit:

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server instead of the old Probot command.\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: force clean build and ensure direct command execution\n\nRENDER PLATFORM CACHING ISSUE DISCOVERED:\n- Render still executing 'npm run start' despite startCommand change\n- Platform appears to be using cached deployment configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server instead of the old Probot command.\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: force clean build and ensure direct command execution\n\nRENDER PLATFORM CACHING ISSUE DISCOVERED:\n- Render still executing 'npm run start' despite startCommand change\n- Platform appears to be using cached deployment configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's preventing\nour correct Express implementation from executing.\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat:

errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js

Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server instead of the old Probot command.\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: force clean build and ensure direct command execution\n\nRENDER PLATFORM CACHING ISSUE DISCOVERED:\n- Render still executing 'npm run start' despite startCommand change\n- Platform appears to be using cached deployment configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's preventing\nour correct Express implementation from executing.\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat:

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific

v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By:

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit:

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By:

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n-

best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express

still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì

  "Message": "feat: DriftGuard MVP - minimal GitHub App for check runs\n\n* demo: PR that should fail (threshold 0.99)\n\n* trigger new workflow run\n\n* fix: use .promptops.yml and add robust error handling\n\n* trigger: fresh run to verify fail behavior\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger Actions for demo\n\n* chore: trigger webhook\n\n* ci: retrigger robust app (FAIL)\n\n* ci: test fixed handler (FAIL)\n\n* feat(app): add workflow_run.completed handler, health endpoint, structured logs, PM2 config\n\n* docs(app): add local ops guide + smoke script\n\n- Add comprehensive README with PM2 operations guide\n- Add smoke test script for validating check runs\n- Add 5-minute health logging with cron intervals\n- Enhanced logEvent interface for health metrics\n- Production-ready operations documentation\n\n* chore(app): production build \u0026 render blueprint for Probot\n\n* fix(render): remove headers section for node web service\n\n* fix(tsconfig): ensure Node.js types are available for compilation\n\n* feat: modernize to 2025 Node.js and TypeScript standards\n\n- Update imports to use node: prefix for built-in modules (stream, http)\n- Add explicit TypeScript Node.js types configuration\n- Fix HTTP server callback type annotations\n- Align with 2025 best practices per ESLint node/prefer-node-protocol\n\nThis resolves the Render build failures by using modern module resolution.\n\n* fix: remove explicit types configuration to use default @types resolution\n\nTypeScript automatically includes all @types/* packages when no explicit types array is specified.\nThe explicit 'node' type was incorrect - should be automatic from @types/node package.\n\n* fix: revert to non-prefixed imports for CommonJS compatibility\n\nThe node: prefix requires moduleResolution: node16 or nodenext, which is incompatible\nwith CommonJS module output. Since Probot uses CommonJS, we must use:\n- moduleResolution: 'node' (legacy)\n- Non-prefixed imports (stream, http instead of node:stream, node:http)\n\nThis resolves the TypeScript compilation errors on Render.\n\n* fix: install devDependencies during Render build for TypeScript compilation\n\nThe root cause of the build failure was that npm ci in production mode doesn't\ninstall devDependencies, which includes @types/node and @types/unzipper needed\nfor TypeScript compilation.\n\nAdded --include=dev flag to npm ci to ensure type definitions are available during build.\n\n* fix: remove restrictive lib setting to allow Node.js types\n\nRemoved the explicit lib: ['ES2020'] setting to let TypeScript use its defaults,\nwhich properly includes Node.js types when @types/node is available.\n\n* feat: update to 2025 Probot v14 best practices with getRouter\n\n- Replace deprecated app.route() with modern getRouter() approach\n- Add proper Express router with app-specific prefix /driftguard-checks\n- Consolidate health endpoints to single Express server (no separate HTTP server)\n- Update health check paths: /driftguard-checks/health and /driftguard-checks/probot\n- Fix Render health check configuration\n- Remove unused http import\n- Follow 2025 GitHub App development standards\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat: implement evidence-based Express + createNodeMiddleware solution\n\nRESEARCH-BASED IMPLEMENTATION:\n- Used comprehensive research on Probot v14 2025 best practices\n- Official pattern: Express server + createNodeMiddleware for webhooks\n- Removed incorrect getRouter() approach (only works with Server class)\n\nTECHNICAL CHANGES:\n- Add Express v5.1.0 + @types/express dependencies\n- Refactor index.ts: Extract probotApp function for createNodeMiddleware\n- Create Express server as main entry point with health endpoints\n- Use async middleware pattern for Probot webhook handling\n- Health endpoints: /health (detailed), /probot (simple status)\n- GitHub webhooks: /api/github/webhooks\n- Update package.json: node ./dist/index.js (not probot run)\n- Update render.yaml: /probot health check path\n\nEVIDENCE SOURCES:\n- Official Probot documentation: probot.github.io/docs/http/\n- GitHub discussions and Stack Overflow examples\n- Probot v14 createNodeMiddleware patterns\n- Express v5 TypeScript compatibility\n\nFIXES:\n- TypeError: getRouter is not a function\n- 502 errors from port conflicts\n- Single Express server on single port\n- Render health check integration\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: bypass npm scripts in render.yaml to avoid caching issues\n\nROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS FINDINGS:\n- Git commit had correct Express source code ‚úì\n- Git commit had correct package.json start script ‚úì\n- But Render still executed 'probot run ./dist/index.js' ‚úó\n- Scientific method revealed: caching/override of npm scripts\n\nEMPIRICAL SOLUTION:\n- Use direct command: 'node ./dist/index.js' in render.yaml\n- Bypass npm scripts entirely to avoid any caching\n- Eliminates dependency on package.json configuration\n- Forces Render to use exact command we specify\n\nVERIFICATION:\n- Express source code: ‚úì committed\n- TypeScript compilation: ‚úì working locally\n- Direct command: ‚úì specified in render.yaml\n\nThis should resolve the getRouter TypeError by ensuring Render\nruns our Express server instead of the old Probot command.\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* fix: force clean build and ensure direct command execution\n\nRENDER PLATFORM CACHING ISSUE DISCOVERED:\n- Render still executing 'npm run start' despite startCommand change\n- Platform appears to be using cached deployment configuration\n- Scientific method requires forcing complete rebuild\n\nSOLUTION:\n- Add 'rm -rf dist' to buildCommand to force clean build\n- Maintain direct startCommand: 'node ./dist/index.js'\n- Eliminate any possibility of cached compiled code\n- Force Render to recognize configuration changes\n\nEVIDENCE-BASED APPROACH:\n‚úì Source code: Express + createNodeMiddleware\n‚úì Git commit: Direct startCommand specified\n‚úì Clean build: Forces recompilation from source\n‚úó Platform issue: Render not reading new configuration\n\nThis addresses the deployment platform caching that's preventing\nour correct Express implementation from executing.\n\nü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude \u003cnoreply@anthropic.com\u003e\n\n* feat:
