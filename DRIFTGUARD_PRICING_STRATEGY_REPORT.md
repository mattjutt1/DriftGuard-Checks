**Average Small Team Budget:** $50-150/month for all CI/CD tooling combined

### Enterprise vs SMB Market Split

**Enterprise Tools ($200-4000/month):**
- SonarCloud: $4,000/year (1M lines of code)
- CircleCI Scale: $2,000/month minimum
- GitHub Enterprise: $21/user/month

**SMB Tools ($5-50/month):**
- 80% of market volume
- Price-sensitive, usage-conscious
- Need immediate ROI demonstration

## DEVELOPER BUDGET CONSTRAINTS

### GitHub Actions Usage Patterns (Real Data)

**Free Tier Reality:**
- 2,000 minutes/month included
- **Developer quote:** *"Any test suite serving a dozen developers could chew through it in a couple of days"*
- **Pain point:** *"You can easily run out of minutes and end up having to pay extra fees"*

**Overage Costs:**
- $0.008/minute = $0.48/hour
- **Developer complaint:** *"Default runners cost over $300/month if used non-stop"*
- macOS runners: 10x multiplier ($4.80/hour equivalent)

### Budget Psychology Evidence

**Cost Sensitivity Indicators:**
1. *"GitHub Actions feels awesome but implementation expensive"* - DEV Community
2. *"Suddenly 2000 minutes starts to look like small change"* - Cost concern threads
3. Multiple tools exist specifically to **reduce GitHub Actions costs** (Blacksmith, RunsOn)

**Willingness to Pay Thresholds:**
- **Individual devs:** $5-25/month max
- **Small teams (2-10):** $15-100/month total
- **Growing teams (10-50):** $100-500/month total

## VALUE-BASED PRICING ANALYSIS

### Manual Review Cost Calculation

**Developer Time Saved:**
- Manual prompt review: 15-30 minutes per PR
- Average developer cost: $50-100/hour loaded
- **Value per evaluation:** $12.50-50 saved
- **Monthly value (20 PRs):** $250-1,000 saved

### DriftGuard ROI Calculation

**At $29/month pricing:**
- Break-even: 1-2 manual reviews saved per month
