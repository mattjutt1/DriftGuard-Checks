## CONSISTENCY GUIDELINES FOR EVALUATORS

### Pre-Evaluation Preparation
1. **Review Domain Criteria**: Confirm understanding of domain-specific evaluation adjustments
2. **Calibrate Against Examples**: Review scoring examples for each dimension and score level
3. **Understand Context**: Consider prompt complexity, intended use case, and target audience
4. **Prepare Documentation**: Set up evidence tracking for scoring decisions

### During Evaluation Process
1. **Read Completely**: Review entire prompt before beginning dimensional scoring
2. **Score Systematically**: Evaluate each dimension independently using detailed rubrics
3. **Document Evidence**: Record specific examples supporting each dimensional score
4. **Apply Domain Adjustments**: Use appropriate weighting and criteria for prompt domain
5. **Calculate Carefully**: Apply formulas correctly for overall quality assessment

### Post-Evaluation Validation
1. **Holistic Review**: Ensure calculated score matches subjective quality impression
2. **Consistency Check**: Compare against similar previous evaluations
3. **Professional Usability**: Verify score reflects actual practical utility
4. **Evidence Review**: Confirm adequate documentation for all scoring decisions

### Common Evaluator Pitfalls

#### Scoring Inflation
- **Over-Generous Scoring**: Awarding high scores for basic competence
- **Halo Effect**: High score in one dimension artificially inflating others
- **Expectation Bias**: Scoring based on improvement rather than absolute quality

#### Scoring Deflation
- **Over-Critical Assessment**: Unrealistic expectations for prompt perfection
- **Domain Mismatch**: Applying inappropriate standards for prompt domain
- **Complexity Penalty**: Reducing scores for inherent rather than poor complexity

#### Inconsistency Errors
- **Reference Drift**: Standards changing over evaluation session
- **Context Confusion**: Mixing evaluation criteria across different prompt types
- **Formula Errors**: Mathematical mistakes in overall quality calculation
