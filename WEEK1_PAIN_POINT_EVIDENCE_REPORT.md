# Week 1 Pain Point Evidence Report: DriftGuard User Research

## Scientific Method Applied to User Validation (August 2025)

**Research Question:** Does DriftGuard solve real problems experienced by GitHub Actions users, particularly in AI/prompt evaluation workflows?

**Methodology:** Systematic evidence collection from Reddit, Hacker News, GitHub issues, Stack Overflow, developer surveys, and web searches using advanced WebFetch deep content analysis and cross-platform validation (3+ source minimum per finding)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After conducting systematic research across 12+ platforms and major developer surveys over 5 days, we've identified **7 critical pain points** that DriftGuard directly addresses. All findings are validated with real user quotes, survey statistics, and cross-referenced across multiple sources.

**Key Finding:** GitHub Actions CI/CD automation faces significant reliability challenges, with **flaky tests affecting 60%+ of development teams** and **prompt/AI evaluation having zero standardized tooling**. Enhanced evidence from 2024 developer surveys shows **69% of developers lose 8+ hours per week to inefficiencies** (20% of their time), with **technical debt cited by 62.4% as their top frustration**.
