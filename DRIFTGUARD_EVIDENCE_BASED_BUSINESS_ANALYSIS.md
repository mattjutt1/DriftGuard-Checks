**Verified Cost Structure:**

- **Free Tier:** 1M requests/month, 400,000 GB-seconds compute
- **Paid Tier:** $0.20 per million requests beyond free tier
- **Storage:** $0.0000000309 per GB-second for ephemeral storage

**Cost Modeling by Customer Segment:**

```text
Small Team (10 repositories):
- API calls: ~240/day (87,600 annually)
- Infrastructure cost: $0/month (within free tier)

Medium Company (100 repositories):
- API calls: ~2,400/day (876,000 annually)
- Infrastructure cost: $0-2/month

Enterprise (1,000+ repositories):
- API calls: ~24,000/day (8.76M annually)
- Infrastructure cost: ~$20-50/month
```

**Unit Economics Assessment:**

- Gross margins potentially 90%+ due to minimal infrastructure costs
- Primary costs will be development, customer acquisition, and support

### ❓ Market Opportunity Requires Validation

The primary business risk is market validation. While configuration drift appears to be a legitimate technical problem,
customer pain point severity, competitive landscape completeness, and willingness to pay all require primary research.

### 📋 Clear Next Steps Identified

This analysis provides a research framework to validate market assumptions systematically. The technical foundation
supports proceeding with customer development and competitive analysis as parallel tracks.

### 🎯 Recommendation: Proceed with Customer Development

**Go/No-Go Decision Framework:** Proceed with 4-6 week customer development phase. If >50% of interviewed developers
validate configuration drift as a significant pain point with willingness to pay, continue to technical prototype. If
market validation fails, pivot or discontinue.
