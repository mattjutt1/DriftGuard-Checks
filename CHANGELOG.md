⚠️ **HONEST DEVELOPMENT UPDATE** ⚠️

### Added

- **Development Demo**: Basic prompt optimization using system prompts (NOT actual PromptWizard framework)
- **Ollama Integration**: Direct HTTP client for qwen3:4b model with basic error handling
- **UI Components**: Mock components showing intended functionality (many imports commented out)
- **Backend Structure**: Convex actions and mutations (partial implementation)

### Technical Reality

- convex/ollama.ts: Basic HTTP client for localhost:11434
- convex/promptwizard.ts: System prompt templates (NOT Microsoft PromptWizard implementation)
- convex/actions.ts: Action handlers (limited error handling)
- src/hooks/useOptimization.ts: Hook imports commented out - not implemented
- src/components/: UI components exist but many dependencies missing

### Performance Warnings

- **Processing Time**: 60-120 seconds per optimization (10-40x slower than acceptable)
- **Quality Scores**: Hardcoded 87% scores in many places (NOT real optimization results)
- **Architecture**: localhost:11434 dependency prevents production deployment
- **Error Handling**: Basic try/catch blocks, limited retry logic

### Limitations Documented

- Development demo only - not production ready
- Many claimed features not actually implemented
- Quality improvements not validated through testing
- Local-only architecture with significant deployment barriers
