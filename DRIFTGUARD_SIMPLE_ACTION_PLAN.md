# üéØ DriftGuard: SIMPLE Path to First Dollar

## THE TRUTH (No BS)

**What You Have:** A GitHub App that creates empty check runs (useless)  
**What You Need:** Add 50 lines of code to make it useful  
**Time to First Dollar:** 48 hours if you start NOW

---

## üî¥ STOP OVERTHINKING - START DOING

### Hour 1-2: Add SIMPLEST Evaluation (30 lines of code)

```javascript
// Just check 3 things users actually care about
function evaluatePrompt(content) {
  const checks = {
    not_empty: content.length > 10,
    not_too_long: content.length < 5000,
    no_secrets: !content.includes('api_key') && !content.includes('password')
  };
  
  return {
    pass: Object.values(checks).every(v => v),
    message: checks.not_empty ? 'Prompt OK' : 'Prompt too short or contains issues'
  };
}
```

**That's it. Ship it.**

### Hour 3: Deploy to Render.com

```bash
cd apps/driftguard-checks-app
git push origin main
# Go to render.com, connect repo, deploy
# Total cost: $7/month
```

### Hour 4: Create GitHub Marketplace Listing

**Title:** DriftGuard - Stop Flaky Prompt Tests  
**Price:** $19/month flat rate  
**Description:** "Your prompts pass or fail. No flaky tests. No manual reviews."

### Day 2: Get First Customer

**Where to Post:**
1. Reddit r/github: "I made a tool to fix flaky AI tests in GitHub Actions"
2. Hacker News: "Show HN: DriftGuard - Deterministic prompt evaluation for CI/CD"
3. Reply to Stack Overflow questions about flaky tests with your solution

## üí∞ REALISTIC MONEY PATH

### Week 1: Proof of Life
- **Goal:** 1 paying customer at $19/month
- **How:** Direct outreach to people complaining about the problem
- **Validation:** If nobody pays $19, pivot or quit

### Month 1: Find Product-Market Fit
- **Goal:** 10 customers = $190 MRR
- **How:** Add ONE feature they request (not 10 features)
- **Learning:** What makes them stay vs leave?

### Month 3: Scale What Works
- **Goal:** 100 customers = $1,900 MRR
- **How:** Double down on the channel that brought first 10 customers
- **Pricing Test:** Try $29/month for new customers

### Month 6: Real Business
- **Goal:** 500 customers = $10,000 MRR
- **Decision Point:** Worth continuing or sell?

## ‚ö° WHAT TO BUILD (ONLY AFTER CUSTOMERS PAY)

### After 1 Customer Pays:
- Add their #1 requested feature

### After 10 Customers Pay:
- Add pass/fail threshold configuration
- Basic metrics (how many checks run)

### After 50 Customers Pay:
- Drift detection (compare to previous version)
- Email notifications

### After 100 Customers Pay:
- Team features
- Better reporting

**DO NOT BUILD ANYTHING ELSE UNTIL PEOPLE PAY**

## üö´ WHAT NOT TO DO (SERIOUSLY, DON'T)

‚ùå Build complex scoring algorithms  
‚ùå Add 10 different metrics  
‚ùå Create beautiful dashboards  
‚ùå Write 1000 lines of code  
‚ùå Spend weeks "perfecting" it  
‚ùå Build features nobody asked for  
‚ùå Price at $500/month  

---

## ‚úÖ EXACTLY WHAT TO DO TODAY

### Next 30 Minutes:
```bash
# 1. Add the simple evaluation function
cd apps/driftguard-checks-app/src
# Add 30 lines of evaluation code

# 2. Test it works
npm run build
npm test

# 3. Commit
git add -A
git commit -m "Add simple prompt evaluation"
git push
```

### Next 2 Hours:
1. Deploy to Render.com ($7/month)
2. Update GitHub App webhook URL
3. Test with a real PR

### Tonight:
1. Create GitHub Marketplace listing
2. Write Reddit post
3. Go to bed knowing you SHIPPED

### Tomorrow:
1. Post on Reddit/HN
2. Find 10 people complaining about flaky tests
3. Send them your link
4. Get first customer

## üìä SUCCESS METRICS (ONLY ONES THAT MATTER)

**Day 1:** Code deployed ‚úì/‚úó  
**Day 2:** First user tries it ‚úì/‚úó  
**Week 1:** First customer pays $19 ‚úì/‚úó  
**Month 1:** 10 paying customers ‚úì/‚úó  

If you hit these, keep going.  
If you don't, pivot or stop.

## üéØ THE BRUTAL TRUTH

Your documents show:
- **Problem is real:** Teams waste $250-1000 per manual review
- **Market exists:** $870M addressable market
- **Solution works:** You have the infrastructure

But you have:
- **ZERO customers**
- **ZERO revenue**  
- **ZERO market presence**

The ONLY thing that matters is getting the FIRST paying customer.

Not the perfect product.  
Not beautiful code.  
Not comprehensive features.

**Just. Get. One. Customer.**

## üí° FINAL WORD

You're sitting on a potential goldmine but acting like you need to build Fort Knox before selling a single gold nugget.

**Ship the simplest thing that could possibly work.**

If it sucks, customers will tell you.  
If nobody wants it, you saved months of work.  
If it works, you can improve it with real revenue.

**The best code is the code that makes money.**

Stop reading. Start shipping.

**RIGHT NOW ACTION:**

Open your code editor.  
Add 30 lines of evaluation code.  
Deploy.  
Find one customer.

That's it. That's the plan.

**GO. üöÄ**
